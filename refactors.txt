1. Placeholder files. Make the properties of the objects also capitalized since they are also the constants
2. In the file App.js, No props should be passed apart from authentication ones.
eg:
    <AsyncCategory
      category='connect'
      categoryName='Connect'
      categoryHeader='Catch up on everything at NITR in this section. From Academics to Fests, find everything on campus here.'
    />

    THIS IS NOT AT ALL A GOOD PRACTICE SINCE THAT FILE IS TO JUST HANDLE THE ROUTING AND NOTHING ELSE!

3. Categorize import statements!
4.
